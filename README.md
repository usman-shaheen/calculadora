# Weeks from Today Calculator

This is a simple "Weeks from Today" calculator web application that allows users to input a number of weeks and calculates the date that corresponds to that number of weeks from the current date.

## Usage

1. Open the "index.html" file in a web browser.
2. Input the desired number of weeks in the input field and press the "Calculate" button.
3. The application will display the calculated date that corresponds to the input number of weeks from today.

## Files

- **index.html:** This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the calculator interface.
- **styles.css:** This file contains the styling for the calculator interface.
- **script.js:** This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for handling the calculation and displaying the result.

## Functionality

- When the "Calculate" button is clicked, the JavaScript code calculates the future date by adding the input number of weeks to the current date.
- The calculated date is then displayed in a user-friendly format using the `toLocaleDateString` function.
- If the input is not a valid number, an error message is displayed.

## Customization
